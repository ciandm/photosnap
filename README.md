# Photosnap website

## Website for a fictional company, Photosnap, built with React & Sass from the design by [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/photosnap-multipage-website-nMDSrNmNW).

I enjoyed creating this site, and getting it as close to the design as possible.

**Please note: as this is a fictional site, some links are wrong. Were this a real site, they would link to correct content.**

### A few issues I ran into that I was able to learn from:
1. Creating the table for comparing plans was tough, and I initially planned on doing 2 versions - one for mobile and another for tablet and up. Was able to create a table for all sizes from the one markup.
2. The gradient on the footer icons was pulling in the wrong gradient, and had to change the ID's of the SVGs so it could pull in the correct gradient in the CSS.
3. I did consider using background-images for the content with images, however I opted for img tags instead for a potential SEO perspective, as a site like this would likely have high quality images to showcase. Strong alt tags help here too.
